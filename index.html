                <h1 style="font-size: 32px;">About Curie</h1>

                <p>Marie Curie,née Maria Sklodowska, was born in Warsaw on November 7, 1867, the daughter of a
                    secondary-school teacher. She received a general education in local schools and some scientific
                    training
                    from her father. She became involved in a students' revolutionary organization and found it prudent
                    to
                    leave Warsaw, then in the part of Poland dominated by Russia, for Cracow, which at that time was
                    under
                    Austrian rule. In 1891, she went to Paris to continue her studies at the Sorbonne where she obtained
                    Licenciateships in Physics and the Mathematical Sciences. She met Pierre Curie, Professor in the
                    School
                    of Physics in 1894 and in the following year they were married. She succeeded her husband as Head of
                    the
                    Physics Laboratory at the Sorbonne, gained her Doctor of Science degree in 1903, and following the
                    tragic death of Pierre Curie in 1906, she took his place as Professor of General Physics in the
                    Faculty
                    of Sciences, the first time a woman had held this position. She was also appointed Director of the
                    Curie
                    Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914.
                    Her early researches, together with her husband, were often performed under difficult conditions,
                    laboratory arrangements were poor and both had to undertake much teaching to earn a livelihood. The
                    discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896 inspired the Curies in their brilliant
                    researches
                    and analyses which led to the isolation of polonium, named after the country of Marie's birth, and
                    radium. Mme. Curie developed methods for the separation of radium from radioactive residues in
                    sufficient quantities to allow for its characterization and the careful study of its properties,
                    therapeutic properties in particular.</p>

            <p>As a teenager, Curie made a pact with her sister Bronya: she would support Bronya while she was in
                medical school in Paris, and then Bronya would pay Curie's way. From the age of 17, for six years, Curie
                worked as a governess and tutor, while attempting to study in her spare time.</p>

                <p class="image-details" style="color: gray;">On 25 June 1903 Marie Curie defended her doctoral thesis
                    on radioactive
                    substances at Université de
                    la
                    Sorbonne in Paris, thus becoming the first woman in France to receive a doctoral degree. Image shows

            <div>
                <h1 class="detail-header">This is radiation </h1>
                <p class="image-details2">Curie decided to do her thesis on radiation, recently discovered in uranium by
                    Henri Becquerel. She
                    found
                    that an ore containing uranium was far more radioactive than could be explained by its uranium
                    content.
                    This led her and her husband, Pierre, to the discovery of a new element that was 400 times more
                    radioactive than uranium. In 1898 it was added to the Periodic Table as polonium, named after
                    Curie's
                    birth country.</p>
                <p class="image-details2 ">Then Curie discovered an even more radioactive element, radium, and, through
                    observation of radium,
                    made a fundamental discovery: Radiation wasnt dependent on the organisation of atoms at the
                    molecular level; something was happening inside the atom itself. The atom was not, as scientists
                    believed at the time, inert, indivisible, or even solid.</p>

                <p class="perrie-text2">Pierre Curie was the love of Curie's life and her partner in science. They met
                    in 1894 when Marie
                    Curie
                    worked in Pierre Curie's lab; they were married the following year.The couple had two
                    daughters,Irène and Eve, and a few years after they married, Pierre Curie abandoned his own research
                    to
                    join his wife's study of radioactivity. The Curies affair of the heart and mind ended tragically not
                    long after Eve was born. In 1906, Pierre Curie was run over by a horse and carriage and killed.
                    Curie believed scientific research was a public good and championed its utility. She and her husband
                    had
                    discovered that radium destroyed diseased cells faster than healthy cells, and thus that radiation
                    could
                    be used to treat tumours.

                <p class="perrie-text2">
                    During World War I, Curie promoted the use of X-rays; she developed radiological cars - which later
                    became known as “petites Curies” - to allow battlefield surgeons to X-ray wounded soldiers and
                    operate more accurately.

            The Curies did not fully appreciate the danger of the radioactive materials they handled. Pierre Curie gave
            himself a lesion when he purposely exposed his arm to radium. Worse, however, was working for years in a
            poorly ventilated shed, isolating radium salts from tons of pitchblende ore.</p>

            <p>Marie Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 alongside her husband Pierre Curie and
                physicist Henri Becquerel.This recognition was given for their pioneering research on radioactivity, a
                term Marie herself coined.
                Their collaborative work built on Becquerel's initial discovery of spontaneous radiation in uranium.
                The Curies further demonstrated that radiation was not a chemical reaction, but rather a fundamental

                <p class="awards2">Together with her husband, she was awarded half of the Nobel Prize for Physics in
                    1903, for their
                    study
                    into the spontaneous radiation discovered by Becquerel, who was awarded the other half of the Prize.
                    In
                    1911 she received a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, in recognition of her work in
